## Search engine submission


Use the following to submit to all the major search engines:
[http://www.diggza.com/](http://www.diggza.com/)

I have no idea how much affect this has (if any). But there's no way it can harm anything, so why not?


## Rubbish links


If you're skeptical about the first part, then skip it and move on to this. It definitely does work. Use the following services to submit your site. They create thousands of low quality links to your site. It probably won't be enough to push your site to number one but something is better than nothing.

Sites are listed in order of how good they are. So if you get bored half way through, you've at least done the best ones.


## Site maps


Make a sitemap, submit it everywhere! sign up for [google](http://www.google.com/webmasters), [yahoo](https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit) and [Bing](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmasters/) webmaster tools and submit your sitemaps to those.

If you're an e-commerce site, a [google products feed](http://google.com/merchants) is a brilliant idea.
