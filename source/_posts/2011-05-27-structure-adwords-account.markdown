There's no hard and fast rules for this. It really depends on the type of client you're dealing with. As well as the styles listed below, you could also make campaigns based on device, coverage (ad network or search results only) or geographical location. Here's some ideas to get you started.



## Large online retailer with lots of products


In general, you should have at least 3 campaigns. Basically, a new campaign for each type of promotion. eg. A campaign called "competitions", as well as those listed below.







Campaign
Example Ad groups
Example Keywords







**Brand Specific**
All keywords should contain the company name






	
  * Sony Digital Cameras

	
  * Sony Televisions

	
  * Sony Playstation









	
  * Sony playstation

	
  * Sony playstation controller

	
  * Sony playstation 3









**Online Shop**
If they have an online store, you should make a separate campaign to target this.






	
  * tv's

	
  * computers

	
  * playstation 1

	
  * playstation 2

	
  * playstation 3


_1 per product range_






	
  * [VPCF21Z1E] _ - a sony vio laptop product code_

	
  * [playstation 1 console]

	
  * [playstation 3]


_exact matches work great as you're targeting those looking for specific products_






**Competitors**
Including their company name makes these low cost and lucrative. You never know, they might be looking for an alternative to that brand?






	
  * Competitors









	
  * [microsoft xbox 360]

	
  * [nintendo wii]

	
  * [Panasonic television]

## Large well known brand, with very few products


The difference here, is that you create a campaign per product. Making several different adverts for each product. This works well in any situation, It's just too time consuming for those with a large product catalogue. This also allows you to change your spend for each product, and to push specific products at specific times of day / year. It also makes it easy to remove all adverts for a product, should it become discontinued.

## Single service company


This works well for things like catering companies, plumbers or anyone else who only provides a single product or service. You can theme each campaign to a specific event or problem that your service / product solves. This allows for very deeply targeted ads.
