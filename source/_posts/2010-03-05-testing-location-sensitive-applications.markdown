I have recently added a new feature to the iPhone version of the [ON Brighton app](http://www.on-uk.com) where by, if you're more than 50 miles away from Brighton. You are alerted, and a suggestion is made to select a location (instead of going by gps).

The problem is. How do you test it? On Android you can use mock location services but on the iPhone, there's nothing!
Looks like i have a long drive ahead of me :-(
