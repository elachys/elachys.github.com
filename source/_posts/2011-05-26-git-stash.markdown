Made changes to your local files but don't want to commit them yet?
Stash your changes, do something else. Commit, and load back in your changes.


## Stash a commit


This will stash a commit with a helpful name / phrase that you can use to jog your memory later on.
`$ git stash save usefulname`


## List stashed commits


This will show all your currently stashed commits.
`$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on branch-name ....
stash@{1}: WIP on dbranch-name: ....
stash@{2}: On branch-name: ....
`


## Apply a stash


You can revert back to a stash at any time as follows.
`$ git stash apply stash@{0}`


## Removing a stash


Even after applying a stash, they still hang around. You can remove them as follows:
`$ git stash drop stash@{0}`


## Clear all stashed entries


`$ git stash clear`
